Whatever magic that was used to invoke Susana's immortality and the reason why the town is trapped, it's locked away in the Plath house somewhere.  \r<br/> <br/>As suspected, the reason for the feud between Susuana and the Plaths is a misunderstanding -- she DID get kill Nelson Plath killed, but she didn't mean to.  It also means that Nelson Plath controlled Coxwette in the same way Susana does now, and the reason why the town is timeless is that the spell's purpose is to create a 'perfect immortality' -- one that not only prevents the caster from aging, but also prevents the community from aging so one never has to say 'good-bye'.\r<br/> <br/>But because Nelson was killed, it means that the only one who knew how to break the spell over Coxwette is gone.\r<br/> <br/>Susana does not control this spell.  She knows the most about it but she doesn't know everything about it.  She's trapped here like everyone else, and just doing her best.  Which means the Plaths and Susana need to work together to break this spell and banish the monsters...  and they need to work fast before cancer takes Ramona.<br/>\n</blockquote>", "spoiler": false, "isAuthor": false, "poster": "Smik", "image": null, "pColor": "a5dbd4"}, {"body": "<blockquote style=\"border-left:5px solid #0f78b2\">\n<div style=\"display:inline-block; width:400px;\"></div><br/>\n<a class=\"ref|questarch|759736|760760\" href=\"/kusaba/questarch/res/759736.html#760760\" onclick=\"return highlight('760760', true);\">&gt;&gt;760760</a> <br/>Lots of traitors (using the term loosely) don't have the stomach to witness the consequences of their treachery.

We know Chuck's system doesn't have enough reveyee to block the speech; Chuck has actually had carnal speech used on him while being aware of it, so he'll know if it's working or not; and if the Plath's have any remaining doubt about how close Chuck has gotten to the mayor they may not want to risk giving him such a power with one of them undefended against it.  Have one of these fine ladies use the speech on you, Chuck.\r<br/> <br/>Don't say anything about this, but I'm sure it's gonna be Ramona.

The spell's obsuvicating your memories of time is supposed to be strong enough that you think he's your greatxwhatever grandfather, when could be your dad or brother. Even if the part about him being your greatxgrandpa being true, since he and Susanna were immortal speakers, you could have still met him in the flesh then the spell made you forget whenever Susanna finally took over Nelson's work after accepting it and killing the Reverands.\r<br/> <br/>I mean, my running theory is that the Reverie and/or blood connection to Plath IS the reason why only the Plath's are allowed to grow old and die, but if that's NOT the case, you probably won't die and forget about the cancer eventually thanks to the spell's effects.\r<br/> <br/>Also, maybe we should bring up the fact that Sally's dad is probably a Zombie out there, walking in infinite fields of infinite.
